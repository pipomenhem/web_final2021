<h3>what is lolar </h3>
 <h4>The "Lollar" is a deposit denominated in US dollars in the Lebanese banking system. 
        It is a nominal balance stuck or frozen in the Lebanese banks, with currency value simply as a computer entry.
         The Lollar is not a tangible currency, but is a concept of an outstanding deposit in US dollars in Lebanese
          banks that can only be withdrawn in Lebanese pounds at a very reduced set rate and considerably lower than
           the highly speculative black market rate which is multiple times higher. There are also limits put on the total amount that can be withdrawn on the lollars. 
         The symbol of the lollar is LOL. The term was coined by Harvard University economic fellow Dan Azzi
          after the Lebanese banks suffered serious difficulties and restricted the amount of US dollars
           and other foreign currencies they 
          could pay to their depositors.</h4>
